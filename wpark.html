                The primeval forest habitat shows expelled, formerly native species such as wolf, lynx and wildcat. Species that are new to our region are, for example, the raccoon or the raccoon dog. As representatives of the native wild animal species, we can observe three different types of deer, foxes, badgers, storks or pheasants in spacious animal-friendly facilities.

                The aim of our zoo is to show domestic wild animals in a way that visitors are not used to. This way, animals that are widespread here can be shown in an interesting way and from a different perspective. The park focused on owls. Tawny Owl Ossi is the mascot of the park. Tawny Owl Ossi lives in a forest area with his family, the other owls, and his wild friends the other wild animals in the forest. Ossi and his family are at home in the owl myth forest, his relatives little owl and long-eared owl also live here.
